        <h2>A Piece of Planet</h2>
        <p>
            This project was made in a small group of three artists and two programmers, including me. Being a game made for a course at DAE, we had one semester to make it - from start to finish.
        </p>

        <p>
            Featuring a spherical, tiled planet, you play as an astronaut protecting a scientist from the inhabitants of the planet. Killed enemies have a chance of dropping a bomb, which explodes
            if not defused in time. Bit by bit, the explosions will cause the planet to literally fall apart, making the terrain more and more dangerous to the player.
        </p>

        <h2>What's your life worth?</h2>
        <p>
            In this bullethell, you stumble upon a special bow, locked into a chest. Together with the talking weapon, you make your way trough chambers filled with enemies in order to finally kill the last boss.
            Along the road, you will find magical fountains, providing you with the opportunity to upgrade your bow - but beware, the upgrade will use your hp as catalyst.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>What's your life worth?</em> was made by me, entirely from scratch. This is another project from DAE and we had about 6 weeks to work our way from two random words to a fully working slice of a game.

        <h2>Combat Arena</h2>
        <p>
            While this project has some gaming elements, this was more of a learning experience then an actual attempt at making a full blown game. Again a project made for a course at DAE, this one took me about 7 weeks.
