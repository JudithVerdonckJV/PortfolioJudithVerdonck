                <h4>The project</h4>
                <p>
                    Fast paced combat systems, especially those set in magical/medieval scenery, have always intrigued me. Games like Hellblade feature few skills with a wide range of use of those options, and
                    games like Black Desert Online feature a wide range of skills, which are linked to stats that all influence the outcome of a fight. This is why I decided I wanted to try something similar,
                    on a much smaller scale.<br />
                    However, while getting my first few animations into UE and trying to get those to work together, I noticed that what I knew of the animation system amounted to... well, basically nothing.
                    I knew how to use a blendspace to make a character walk around and strafe nicely, and I knew how to use a bool to fire a simple shooting animations. That was about it. Knowing that making a combat system
                    largely hinged on the animations behind it, I decided to temporarily leave the combat system for what it was and instead started looking into documentation and tutorials about animating in UE4.

                <h4>Learning instead of making a game</h4>
                <p>
                    As this was for an assignment, one that clearly stated we were supposed to make a <em>game</em>, when I let go of the idea of actually making a game, I did this very consciously. I knew that what
                    I was doing was not within what was asked from us, and I knew I wouldn't have the time to still make a game after I learned all I wanted to learn. Still, I wanted to do this - we had only gotten
                    some very basic pointers in UE up to that moment, and I wanted to dive deeper into it.<br />
                    After the assignment (and after exams), I still did some extra research into UE's animation system, trying out some of the more complex things.<br />
                    All in all, I learned about notifications and its siblings, I looked into montages for combo's, learned about root motion (and what animations where absolutely terrible for it...), tried out
                    some foot IK, got a handle on blending animations and found out how to properly detect hits.
