                <h4>The project</h4>
                <p>
                    Fast paced combat systems, especially those set in magical/medieval scenery, have always intrigued me. This is why I decided I wanted to try something similar,
                    on a much smaller scale.<br />
                    However, while getting my first few animations into UE and trying to get those to work together, I noticed that what I knew of the animation system amounted to... well, basically nothing.
                    Knowing that making a <b>combat system largely hinged on the animations</b> behind it, I decided to temporarily leave the combat system for what it was and instead started looking into
                    <b>documentation and tutorials about animating in UE4</b>.

                <h4>Learning instead of making a game</h4>
                <p>
                    As this was for an assignment, one that clearly stated we were supposed to make a <em>game</em>, when I let go of the idea of actually making a game, I did this very consciously. I knew that what
                    I was doing was not within what was asked from us, and I knew I wouldn't have the time to still make a game after I learned all I wanted to learn. Still, I wanted to do this - we had only gotten
                    some very basic pointers in UE up to that moment, and I wanted to dive deeper into it.<br />
                    After the assignment (and after exams), I still did some extra research into UE's animation system, trying out some of the more complex things.<br />
                    All in all, I learned about <b>notifications</b> and its siblings, I looked into <b>montages</b> for combo's, learned about <b>root motion</b> (and what animations were absolutely terrible for it...),
                    tried out some <b>foot IK</b>, got a handle on <b>blending animations</b> and found out how to properly detect hits.
