                <h4>The project</h4>
                <p>
                    One of the courses at DAE puts us together with four to five other students in order to make a game. We get nothing except deadlines and a very wide restriction
                    (like "co-op", "twinstick", ...), the rest is up to us.<br />
                    Our group consisted of two programmers, counting myself, and three artists:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Myself; Judith Verdonck, programmer</li>
                        <li><a href="https://tomkalders.github.io/index.html" target="_blank">Tom Kalders</a>, programmer</li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.artstation.com/hasu" target="_blank">Tatiana Devos</a>, artist</li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.artstation.com/lark_art" target="_blank">Lars Korden</a>, artist</li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.artstation.com/maramt95" target="_blank">María Martínez</a>, artist</li>
                    </ul>
                    After brainstorming, we had a good grasp on what we wanted to do, and we were immediatly faced with a few coding challenges in the very foundation of our game mechanics,
                    most of which I tackled.<br />
                    This project was not my first time using Unreal Engine, but it was the <b>first time using c++ in Unreal</b>. It made for a slow start, but we quickly adapted.
                </p>

                <h4>Contribution</h4>
                
                <h5>Programming</h5>
                <p>
                    The first problem we had to solve, was the gravity. Unreal's gravity points down over the z-axis, while we had a spherical world. This meant we had to have <b>gravity pointing to an
                    arbitrary point</b>. The gravity I made is not physically correct - there is no acceleration for example - because in this game, that kind of  accuracy was not needed.<br />
                    The second, way bigger problem, was making our <b>planet consist out of destuctible tiles</b>, each with their own bit of code. In other words, in order to not have to painstakingly
                    place all of the tiles by hand, they somehow needed to be <b>generated in place</b>. While the code that solved this particular problem isn't complex, there was quite a bit of
                    research and testing involved.

                <p>
                    My other responsibilities were making all the <b>enemy classes</b> and getting the <b>animation blueprints</b> up and running for <em>everything</em>, as I was the only one with any experience
                    with Unreal's animation system. In the end, I also did part of the UI (mostly the menu's), as we were running out of time.
                </p>
                
                <h5>Design</h5>
                <p>
                    Coming up with the idea for the game was something we did in group, but as I took up the lead, I was often the one to either <b>spark discussion, or make final decisions</b>.
                    An example of this would be the <b>destructible tiles</b>. As we were working in a rather small playfield (after settling on the planet-theme), I thought it would be nice if this
                    environment itself would be a game mechanics factor. Someone came up with the idea of biomes, which ended up as the Tundra, Forest and Desert tiles, and I came up with the idea of
                    having the planet be destructible. Of course, it is not as clear cut as that - these ideas grow very organically and often receive input and changes from all sides. Still, the base
                    comes from somewhere, and I can confidently say I have played a big role in how that base was build up.
                </p>
                
                <h5>Other</h5>
                <p>
                    I took up the responsibility of writing the weekly devlogs. While it sometimes was hard to properly word what the artists had done, as I had a less complete view on their struggles and
                    tests, I had a lot of fun telling all the ups and downs we went through as a team.
