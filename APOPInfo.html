                <h4>The project</h4>
                <p>
                    One of the courses at DAE puts us together with four to five other students in order to make a game. We get nothing except deadlines and a very wide restriction
                    (like "co-op", "twinstick", ...), the rest is up to us.<br />
                    Our group consisted of two programmers, counting myself, and three artists:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Myself; Judith Verdonck, programmer</li>
                        <li>Tom Kalders, programmer</li>
                        <li>Tatiana Devos, artist</li>
                        <li>Lars Korden, artist</li>
                        <li>María Martínez, artist</li>
                    </ul>
                    After brainstorming, we had a good grasp on what we wanted to do, and we were immediatly faced with a few coding challenges in the very foundation of our game mechanics,
                    most of which I tackled.<br />
                    This project was not my first time using Unreal Engine, but it was the <b>first time using c++ in Unreal</b>. It made for a slow start, but we quickly adapted.
                </p>

                <h4>My part</h4>
                <p>
                    The first problem we had to solve, was the gravity. Unreal's gravity points down over the z-axis, while we had a spherical world. This meant we had to have <b>gravity pointing to an
                    arbitrary point</b>. The gravity I made is not physically correct - there is no acceleration for example - because in this game, that kind of  accuracy was not needed.<br />
                    The second, way bigger problem, was making our <b>planet consist out of destuctible tiles</b>, each with their own bit of code. In other words, in order to not have to painstakingly place all of the tiles
                    by hand, they somehow needed to be <b>generated in place</b>. While the code that solved this particular problem isn't complex, there was quite a bit of research and testing involved.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My other responsibilities were making all the <b>enemy classes</b> and getting the <b>animation blueprints</b> up and running for <em>everything</em>, as I was the only one with any experience
                    with Unreal's animation system. In the end, I also did part of the UI (mostly the menu's), as we were running out of time.<br />
                    While not related to coding in particular, I wrote all of the <b>devlogs</b> on the Itch.io page.
