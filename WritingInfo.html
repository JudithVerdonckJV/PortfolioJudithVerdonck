                Stories follow me everywhere, whether I am simply biking along the road, sleeping, or on a rollercoaster in a theme park. Some of these I write down, and over the years, I built a whole
                world in which the bulk of my (written) stories are situated. Below, you can find the short-story "Serzona", which takes place in this universe. It was originally written in Dutch.<br />
                The collection of short texts below Serzona was made after reading a whole bunch of Lovecraft's works, prompting me to write something in a Lovecratian universe, in - more or less - his style of writing.
            </p>

            <p>
                To be completely honest, I have no idea how good or bad I am at writing. Writing is one of those skills that are really hard to rank, as it also depends on who your reader is, what your style is,
                what you are trying to accomplish. I generally have the feeling I am at least above average, even if that is simply because I have had way more practice then other people. Feel free to read the two
                pieces of storywriting I have included below, to see and judge for yourself.<br />

            <h2>Serzona</h2>
            <p>
                Have you ever heard Serzona's story, the story of the little flute player? It is well known in these regions. Has really no one told you about the girl and the wonderful melodies she
                could conjure from her obsidian flute? Well, you just got here, maybe that's not so strange. But still. No lonely traveler should pass through this village without at least knowing
                about her existence.<br />
                What do you say? Have people warned you about sweet notes during moonless nights? Yes. That's her. That's little Serzona. Serzona with her shiny black flute, two braids in her hair
                and barefoot.<br />
                Since no one has told you the story yet, I'll do it for you, if you don't mind having this old man in your company for a little longer.
            </p>

            <p>
                Serzona sat on the doorstep of her house playing with a narrow, black glass flute, her fingers dancing over the holes. She had found the instrument in the forest, but when
                the villagers asked her where exactly, she could not answer. She merely gestured to a vague point in the west and said that beyond the bushes, there was a rock in a clearing where she
                had found the flute. Many people were uncomfortable at the sight of the obsidian instrument, which, despite its lightness and slenderness, had an intimidating appearance. In the end nothing
                was done and little Serzona was allowed to play with her find; what harm could a whistle do?<br />
                And Serzona practiced and practiced, until one day she could blow whole melodies on the flute. Her music drifted through the village every night, making the returning famrers pause and look up
                in delight.<br />
                It went on like this for several years, years in which the girl proved that she had a talent for music. She no longer only played the tunes she had heard before, she invented new ones and
                then searched tone after tone for a melody that expressed what she was perceiving until she was able to make others feel what she felt and see what she saw.<br />
                In her thirteenth fall, she went into the forest in search of ripe blackberries and edible mushrooms. On the way back she got lost and was forced to spend the night in the forest. That same,
                long night, death visited the village; Shadehunter appeared and caused death and destruction. Her despair and grief when she found her way back and encountered a village of
                death were unbearable. Defeated, she gathered her few possessions and went back to the forest, westward, where the trees were old and the hills high. There she crawled under ferns and bushes,
                leaving a trail of tears, and only when the vegetation receded did she get up and glance at her surroundings.<br />
                Here it was. This was where she had found her precious flute. Blinded by salty drops, she took the black whistle from her pocket, climbed onto a flat rock, sat down, and began to play. The notes
                were fragile, soft, flew with the wind, bumped into the trunks of the trees and filled the forest with their melody. While she played, she thought back to the years in the village, where she
                had entertained the farmers with her flute, played for her little brother and astonished her friends with the dexterity of her fingers.<br />
                Her tears stopped falling and instead her flute wept, it wept with sounds that carried so much pain that the animals went silent, the wind stopped blowing and the water stopped flowing. The sun,
                which had risen not long ago, retraced its steps and set, the stars appeared, the moon completed its path in a few minutes, and the sun reappeared where it normally disappears behind the horizon.
                And there, in red clouds and a soft pink sky, it stopped, scattering its warm rays over Serzona.
            </p>

            <p>
                They say she is still there, on her rock, among the bushes. It's not that the child itself is dangerous, young man. The danger lies in the time that is standing still. You wouldn't be the first
                to walk unsuspectingly towards the flute playing in the western forest and is then never seen again. After the attack of Shadehunter, this village was rebuilt, perhaps not in exactly the same
                place, but close by, and under the same name. Serzona with her flute lived not far from here, and the clearing in the forest, although no one here dares to look for it, cannot be far either.
                Enjoy her flute playing when you hear it seep through the cracks in your shutters, but don't try to pinpoint its source. I've been told that being trapped in time is one of the less pleasant
                ways of living.

            <h2>A Lovecraftian Universe</h2>
            
            <h4>Of birds and boars</h4>
            <p>
                What is left to believe in? What will be left to believe in?<br />
                Thousands of birds fill the sky, but the boar doesn't care. The boar doesn't need them to live on. And the boar will stay deaf to the song of danger the birds are
                singing, because why would it care? Birds have nothing to do with a boar.<br />
                Untill the fire comes and engulfs all. Birds, boar, world.<br />
                And oh, how much could've been done to prevent that from happening.<br />
                The birds tried. At least they tried.<br />
            </p>

            <h4>Hazyathel</h4>
            <p>
                I AM HAZYATHEL. MY HOME IS THE EVER-CHANGING MISTWORLD OF GUNN'THAG, IN WHICH NO ONE BUT ME CAN NAVIGATE, NO ONE BUT ME CAN DECIDE WHO ENTERS AND NO ONE BUT ME CAN LEAVE.<br />
                THE BRIDGES OF OBLIVION ARE ITS DOORS, THE TERRIBLE BEASTS WITHOUT NAME ARE ITS GUARDS AND THE ARTHAZ TOWERS, CLOAKED IN SHADOWS AND ELUSIVE VISTAS OF UNKNOWN MARVEL, ARE MY THRONE.<br />
                YOU, WHO SUMMONED THE WANDERER OF SPACE AND TIME BY FORCE, STATE YOUR REASON, BEFORE I THROW YOU ON THE BRIDGES AND LEAVE YOU TO THE BEASTS-THAT-CANNOT-BE-NAMED.
            </p>

            <h4>The Curious Inhabitants of Gunn'thags Mirror-Lake</h4>
            <p>
                What do we seek? We do not know. Our ground is blue, the sky is low. At times, we reach out to touch the black that keeps us here, hoping, longing, but stone and rock won't ever budge.<br />
                And so we wander over wavering floor, from edge to edge, our heart still sore; where is the thing that we forgot? What is that faraway call, that faded echo, our minds got?<br />
                Oh, only if we knew - we could stop our endless search and serve our master anew. But until then we shall walk this ever-changing ground, restlessly looking, for eternity bound.
            </p>

            <h4>The Beasts-that-cannot-be-named</h4>
            <p>
                How does one even begin to describe them? Although I am certain that doing so is pure madness, I will give it a try, hoping to capture at least a tiny bit of the queerness of these creatures.<br />
                No matter how unearthly and haunting their appearance may be, they still play a significant role, as they are the guardians of the Mistworld of Gunn'thag They keep intruders that manage to
                pass the Bridge of Oblivion out, and Gunn'thags inhabitants in.<br />
                Their bodies don't seem to have an obvious up- or downside, as both head and torso are symmetrical in almost all directions. The legs - or whatever name you wish to give it - are flexible
                and solid at the same time, like a stronger version of a cats' tail. Any form of paw is missing, instead their legs end in a single, sharp claw. When the Beasts move, they have the tendency
                to randomly roll over, switching between legs while doing so. Inactive legs are normally hanging down, but if you agitate them, the claws start twitching and stirring. As they have the strength
                to rip rock apart and are quite aggressive, it is often the last thing you will see.<br />
                Their head consists almost completely of a big maw, splitting wide open in four to five parts, and is filled with several rows of razor-sharp teeth. Eyes or ears seem to be missing completely,
                and to this day I am unable to say how they find their prey or distinguish friend from foe.<br />
                Scales cover their skin, but unlike the scales I know from snakes or fish, these are soft, gelatinous-like, and are slightly sticky to the touch. I cannot name the color of their skin, as I have
                never seen anything like it before. Sometimes I'm almost sure it is red, but when light or stance changes, it can become black or purple, even a sickly greenish. I'm guessing my mind tries to fill
                in this unknown color with something I recognize, playing tricks on me because it fails to do so.<br />
                I will continue to study the Beasts-that-cannot-be-named, since I still lack knowledge of their behavior and cycle of life, but until then, this is the best I can do.
            </p>

            <h4>The Great Betrayal of the Watchers</h4>
            <p>
                The Watchers. I've heard whispers about them, but every time I ask who - or what - they are, conversations stop and gazes flutter nervously towards the Tower of Bone, where lord Hazyathel
                resides. These whisperers seem to fear the Mistlord notices the subject of their talk.<br />
                From what I've gathered, the Watchers were the second half of the beings that guard this place, together with the Beasts-that-cannot-be-named. They were the spies, roaming the borders of
                this world, and immediately notifying the Beasts whenever something breached these borders.<br />
                It seems that, when the Watchers were still active, the Beasts weren't allowed to wander freely through the Mists, but instead were only let loose whenever the Watchers called them.<br />
                One of the abilities of the Watchers was, if I put the pieces of info together correctly, to see through everything. Put a ten meter-thick wall between you and a Watcher, and it will still see you.<br />
                Only their ability didn't stop there. One day, a Watcher managed to peer through the fabric of time and space and saw countless other worlds and universes, endlessly stretching out in all
                directions. It wasn't long before every Watcher knew of this, and several crossed the Bridge of Oblivion, in an attempt to escape the Mistworld and visit these new places.<br />
                Whether any of them succeeded, I do not know, but what I do know, is that this world only has one rule: creatures only enter with permission of Hazyathel, and nothing but the lord ever leaves.<br />
                When the Mistlord heard about the Watchers trying to leave Gunn'thag, he was enraged, and came up with a plan to punish them. With a list, he led them to the Mirror-Lake and cursed them, taking their
                purpose and memories away and using the qualities of the Lake to render their ability useless. They say the Mirror-Lake reflects everything, and so they cannot see past the edges of the water.<br />
                I myself have not yet found this Mirror-Lake, but I have only explored a mere fraction of this world. Chances are this story is at least partially true and I will eventually stumble upon this Lake with
                its peculiar prisoners.
            </p>

            <h4>Regarding the Collection</h4>
            <p>
                I finally see what this world is. Why I'm here, and not in Heaven - or most likely, Hell.<br />
                This is a collection. Everything, from the bones that adorn the Arthaz Towers to Hate, from the tiny Leafpeople to the Whispering Woods. It was all brought here by the Wanderer of Space and
                Time. All of it. I dare bet even the Guardians, both the Beasts and the Watchers, were originally from another planet in another universe.<br />
                It is both fascinating and humbling to know that this place isn't anything but a patchwork of bits and pieces Hazyathel found during his travels. As I walk through the Mistworld, I myself am
                sort of wandering through time and space. Although I cannot tell beginning from end, I'm following Hazyathel's steps on his journey. The thought excites me.
            </p>

            <h4>About the Whispering Woods and its Shadows of Existence</h4>
            <p>
                Ah, the Whispering Woods. I am unable to say how big an area they cover, as I believe Lord Hazyathel used his powers of time and space on it. Just take from me that, when looking from afar,
                it seems to be about two days worth of travelling going straight from one side to the other, yet when I crossed the Woods, it actually took me a solid two months before encountering plains again.<br />
                Once under the roof of leaves, you step into another world. An old, ruined, but somehow still living world. A world of large, polished stones tucked between a tree's roots; of hidden arcs and
                buried structures. There is no way of telling what happened to this civilization, no way of knowing what was before that, or how long ago its downfall occurred.<br />
                There is only now.<br />
                Still, some survivors are left, if I can even call them alive. I cannot actually see them, although I sometimes have the feeling I almost can. They are movement in the corner of my eye, the
                impression of clear laughter echoing between the trees, strange shadows cast by my campfires. Sometimes something that could be a footprint in the dirt, just vague enough to never be really sure.<br />
                It took me a while to notice them, and I am afraid it might take a lot longer to get to know something about them. Maybe I shall ask the Traveller of Space and Time about the Whispering Woods when - or
                rather, if - I see him again.
