                <p>
                    All the 3D projects I have made were all for assignments at DAE. The very first one was the cityscene, for which I chose to model a Tarifa-inspired part. For a game dev, I definitely spend
                    too much time on this, having fun with adding detail and life to the scene.<br />
                    In general, we were restricted to <b>low poly</b>, and texturing was done with <b>images in photoshop</b>. There was no hard restriction on material slots used, but
                    they did guide us to only use <b>diffuse and opacity</b>. Apart from that, I tried to keep it as diverse as possible while also reusing things like windows and plants.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The second project I made (and again spend too much time on because I was having fun with it) was a <b>high poly</b> model, which we then <b>baked down onto a low poly version</b>. We were free to choose
                    what we used as reference, as long as it was made of at least two different <b>(PBR) materials</b> and had at least two <b>hierarchical joints</b>. In the end, I chose a robotic animal leg, which
                    looked very organic while still having mechanical elements in it.<br />
                    We were never shown how to sculpt, so this leg is completely made with simple modeling. We used Substance Painter for texturing, having a bit of an introduction to it and then basically let
                    loose on it. I mixed some smart generators with manual painting for the end result.
