                <h4>The project</h4>
                <p>
                    As part of our education at Digital Arts and Entertainment, we all do a <b>graduation work involving research</b>, making a project based on that research, and <b>writing a paper</b>
                    about the whole process. I chose the topic "forest fire simulation", which was in cooperation with the University of Leuven. I chose to follow the needs and desires from KU Leuven as closely
                    as possible, although this was not required; they could give topics, but were not clients.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While the topic was indeed <b>wildfire simulation</b>, the actual goal was to <b>visualize a simplified version of the electric signals going over the heart</b>. As such, I made it my primary goal to make a system
                    that would allow me to correctly show wave propagation on a 3D model.
                </p>

                <h4>Research</h4>
                <p>
                    I started my <b>research</b> very broad, looking at recent wildfires and gathering some general information. After that, I started looking into the <b>workings of a wildfire</b>; what causes them to gain or loose speed,
                    what kind of wildfires are there etc. Of course, since I needed to combine this with the human heart, I also briefly looked into the <b>workings of the heart</b>. With the resources provided by KU Leuven, I
                    was able to filter out what I would need for this project.
                </p>

                <h4>Simulator</h4>

                <h5>Grid</h5>
                <p>
                    The first step was to generate a <b>grid</b> large enough to encapsulate the entire mesh, but <b>small enough to not cause unnessecary calculation</b>. This also meant it would need to be hollow - the inside of
                    a mesh should not have any wave propagation going on.<br />
                    The spawning of the grids was made so the user can <b>choose how many cells there are</b>.
                </p>

                <h5>Transform: trees and fire</h5>
                <p>
                    Another difficulty was the transform the trees and fire VFX should have. "Up" wasn't positive Z anymore, and taking the center of a cell did not guarantee it would be anywhere near the terrain surface.
                    I ended up doing <b>linetraces</b> for every edge of the cell and taking an <b>average from all the impact normals and positions</b>. This worked decently well for most geometry and was fast enough to be useble
                    for grid generation.
                </p>

                <h4>Paper</h4>
                <p>
                    We needed to write a paper <b>documenting our research and the making of the project</b> . I also ran <b>tests, looking at fps in various scenarios</b>, and discussed the results.
