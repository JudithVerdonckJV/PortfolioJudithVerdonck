            <h2>2 Games a Month Incubator</h2>
            <h4>What is 2GaM?</h4>
            <p>
                2 Games a Month Incubator is an 18 week program for everyone interested in starting their own indie studio. It cycles through multiple sprints of 2 weeks, where groups go from game design to
                development to presenting the final project. Some of these sprints are for clients, providing extra experience.<br />
                During this years' edition, we ended up with 6 projects: 3 personal ones and 3 projects for clients. In the remaining weeks, we were introduced to making VAF dossiers (Vlaams Audiovisueel Fonds -
                Flemish Audiovisual Funding), trailermaking, marketing etc.
            </p>

            <h4>My internship</h4>
            <p>
                I joined the 2GaM program as my internship, not because I wanted to start my own studio, but because I felt I needed more <b>experience with game design and quick prototyping</b>. Cycling through 6 projects
                definitely was a great way of leveling up those skills, and as groups always changed and sprints were short, I also was able to improve many soft skills - <b>communication and planning</b> on top.

                <h2>Spell Sketchers</h2>
                <h4>The project</h4>
                <p>
                    In this mobile game, the player needs to draw the right patterns on the screen to cast spells. Both spells and enemies have an element assigned to them, and
                    all these elements react in different ways. Using these spells and reactions, you need to protect your base.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There were two more people working on this project:
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://mikageebelen.github.io/MikaGeebelen/" target="_blank">Mika Geebelen</a> (Programmer).</li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.artstation.com/inias" target="_blank">Inias Carpentier</a> (Artist).</li>
                    </ul>
                    The game was made in <b>Unity with C#</b>.
                </p>

                <h4>My contribution</h4>
                <p>
                    This was the first game we made during the 2 Games a Month program and I did a bit of everything on this project.<br />
                    <b>Game design:</b> The original idea came from me, and I kept working on the elemental reactions etc until everything felt right. <br />
                    <b>Producer/lead:</b> I took up the role of project lead during this project. This also meant I often took the final decision and was involved in both the
                    programming side as well as the art side.<br />
                    <b>Programming:</b> I coded some simple behavior for the enemies, to make sure they spawned in and moved in the right way.<br />
                    <b>Level deco:</b> As the artist did not have enough time, I did level deco for a full scene, using the props already available.<br />
                    <b>Trailer:</b> I did the cinematography in Unity, staging shots and using dolly camera's for the best result.<br />
                    <b>Pitching: </b> At the end of the 2-week sprint, I did the presentation of the project.

                <h2>Neon Ninja</h2>
                <h4>The project</h4>
                <p>
                    The prompt for this 2-week sprint was to make a <b>VR or XR exergame</b>. We chose to try and make the project in <b>Unreal Engine 4</b>.<br />
                    In Neon Ninja, the player wields two daggers, each with a different color. Enemies run up and attack, but they have weak spots in one of two colors on their body. Hit those spots
                    and they will die, giving you another precious few seconds to raise that highscore!

                <h4>My contribution</h4>
                <p>
                    This project ended up being very <b>research-heavy</b>, as noone had experience with VR, let alone VR in UE4. I took most of this research on me, as I felt I had enough experience with Unreal Engine itself.<br />
                    I researched how to <b>link the Oculus headset to Unreal Engine</b> and figured out what was happening with the <b>lighting</b> in our scene. I had to try quite a few
                    things, really diving into Unreal Engine's and Oculus' settings for the first time.<br />
                    During and after this research, I also <b>tested</b> the game and did a lot of <b>bugfixing</b>.<br />
                    Lastly, as I had by far the most experience in UE4, I often helped the other teammembers, explaining or showing engine-specific things.

                <h2>Herd Masters</h2>
                <h4>The project</h4>
                <p>
                    Two players with their herd of monsters are pitted against each other, and their only weapon is the ability to scare their own herd away... With this, collisions between the monsters make them bounce away
                    - and hopefully off the map. Protect your own herd while trying to get rid of your opponents' monsters!
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project is a local co-op game and was made in <b>Unity</b>, with two more people:
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://portfolio-740053.webflow.io/" target="_blank">Yann Annaert</a> (Programmer).</li>

                </p>

                <h4>My contribution</h4>
                <p>
                    During this sprint, I did a little bit of pretty much everything. For me, this was by far the most varied project I have worked on during 2 Games a Month.<br />
                    <b>Programming:</b> I did part of the monster movement and part of the events (the falling lucifer).<br />
                    <b>Level deco:</b> <b>Modelling</b> some pieces myself and using props the artist gave me, I <b>setup the entire level</b> and played around with <b>materials and shaders</b> to get the best effect.<br />
                    <b>Concepting:</b> I even dove into some concepting for the monsters. My sketches were used by the artist to further improve our presentation.<br />
                    <b>UI:</b> <b>Design, art and implementation</b> were all done by me.<br />
                    <b>VFX:</b> Starting from existing particle emitters, I learned how to use Unity's VFX system and <b>changed VFX</b> to fit our needs.<br />
                    <b>Promo:</b> I put a lot of time into <b>staging short sequences</b>, both for trailer and for beauty shots. I learned how to use Unity <b>timelines</b> for this.
