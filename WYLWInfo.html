                <h4>The project</h4>
                <p>
                    Being an assignment for Game Mechanics, we had six weeks time to start from 2 random words and end with a small game. There were no restrictions on genre,
                    we had to use Unity, and we worked alone on the project.<br/>
                    The game I created, <em>What's your life worth</em>, is a bullethell about an adventurer finding a magic bow and fighting his way to the end of a dungeon.
                    While the project I managed to make in those six weeks only contains a few chambers, the base idea is there - the player can upgrade his bow in every room, at the cost of some hp.
                    You can also choose to heal, but then you lose the opportunity on an upgrade that might be the difference between life and death in the next room. That way, I tried to <b>create
                    a choice</b> that's more then a mindless click on the "upgrade" button.<br/>
                </p>

                <h4>A learning process</h4>
                <p>
                    I had a little bit of experience in Unity, but I never really dived deep into it. It did mean that I got started up very quickly, following the same tutorials as before, to
                    refresh the things I had used before.<br />
                    After that, however, many things were trial and error, using documentation and experimentation. In the end, I got a decent grasp on the <b>basics of Unity</b>, and I <b>learned some C#</b> in the
                    process.
                </p>

                <h4>Shooting</h4>
                <p>
                    The function that handles shooting has to be the code I spend - relatively speaking - the most time on. Everything that shoots uses it, enemies <em>and</em> player. From the simplest one-bullet-per-second
                    to more complex waves of bullets in all directions, this <b>one function could handle all</b> of it.

                    Once this function in the base class was done, all I needed to do for enemies was derive from it,
                    setup some simple AI, and call the function with the right parameters.
