                <h4>The project</h4>
                <p>
                    Being an assignment for Game Mechanics, we had six weeks time to start from 2 random words and end with a small game. There were no restrictions on genre,
                    we had to use Unity, and we worked alone on the project.<br/>
                    The game I created, <em>What's your life worth</em>, is a bullethell about an adventurer finding a magic bow and fighting his way to the end of a dungeon.
                    While the project I managed to make in those six weeks only contains a few chambers, the base idea is there - the player can upgrade his bow in every room, at the cost of some hp.
                    You can also choose to heal, but then you lose the opportunity on an upgrade that might be the difference between life and death in the next room. That way, I tried to create
                    a choice that's more then a mindless click on the "upgrade" button.<br/>
