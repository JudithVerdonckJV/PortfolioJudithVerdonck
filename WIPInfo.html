                <h4>Curse of the Pyramid</h4>
                <p>
                    A game that combines Egypt, hack'n slash, bullethell and dungeoncrawling into one exciting experience. We started up in summer 2021, dove into it full-time in
                    September, and plan on finishing by Christmas.<br />
                    My role in the team is that of the gameplay programmer, and I take part in discussions about design.<br />
                    I am working together with
                    <a href="https://enriquebrosse.myportfolio.com/" target="_blank">Enrique Brosse</a> (tools programmer and back-end),
                    <a href="https://www.artstation.com/silkevandersmissen" target="_blank">Silke Van Der Smissen</a> (environmental artist),
                    <a href="ttps://www.artstation.com/bentehuhh" target="_blank">Bente Schoone</a> (character artist and animator) and
                    <a href="https://www.artstation.com/gomorrahdotd" target="_blank">Steven Serra Mock</a> (game art generalist).

                    <em>November Update:</em><br />
                    This is the secong big project I do in <b>Unreal Engine 4</b>, and although I still need to look things up quite often, I feel like I have a good grip on the engine and how to use it.
                    I mainly concentrate on the <b>player, weapons, projectiles, enemies and all of the necessary animation blueprinting</b>. Enrique has been doing the dungeon generation and
                    spawners, traps, and puzzles. While our initial idea for the game was too big, we will still be able to make and polish all of the core mechanics.

                <h4>Wildfire simulation - research</h4>
                <p>
                    For the graduation work course at DAE, I stepped into the wildfire simulation project, which is in cooperation with KU Leuven. The ultimate goal is to be able to
                    compare data from the simulation with data from the human heart, and see if it (mathematically) correlates.

                <h4>Crystal Heart</h4>
                <p>
                    This is a personal project of mine and is in a very early phase. I work on this during my free time, mainly writing the design document and sometimes testing a certain mechanic
                    out in Unreal Engine. The ultimate goal is to create a game that plays like a platformer, inside 3D world, with strong story elements to drive the player onwards.
