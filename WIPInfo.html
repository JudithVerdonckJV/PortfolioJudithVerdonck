			<h4>Programming: Curse of the Pyramid - combat modules</h4>
			<p>
				As our project was progressing and deadlines came closer, things simply had to <em>work</em>. This caused the flexibility of the combat system to gradually get lost.<br />
				I wanted to challenge myself while also working on Curse of the Pyramid, and potentially have a system that I could use in other projects as well. With this in mind, I started working on a new combat system.
				This combat system would need to be able to handle combo attacks, different weapons (which should be easy to swap out at runtime) with different attacks, dodging, dodge attacks, interrupts...
			</p>

			<h4>Design: Crystal Heart</h4>
			<p>
				This is a personal project of mine and is in a very early phase. I work on this during my free time, mainly writing the design document and sometimes testing a certain mechanic
				out in Unreal Engine. The ultimate goal is to create a game that plays like a platformer, inside a 3D world, with strong story elements to drive the player onwards.
			</p>

			<h4>Story: Shadehunter</h4>
			<p>
				School has finished and I have picked up my main story again! Taking my old story and stripping it down, I have started reworking parts of the characters and worldbuilding, making sure it all fits
				together. It might still take a while before I can fully dive into writing again, but when it happens, I will have a much clearer red thread available.
