                <h4>Wildfire simulation - research</h4>
                <p>
                    For the graduation work course at DAE, I stepped into the wildfire simulation project, which is in cooperation with KU Leuven. The ultimate goal is to be able to
                    compare data from the simulation with data from the human heart, and see if it (mathematically) correlates.
                </p>

                <h4>Crystal Heart</h4>
                <p>
                    This is a personal project of mine and is in a very early phase. I work on this during my free time, mainly writing the design document and sometimes testing a certain mechanic
                    out in Unreal Engine. The ultimate goal is to create a game that plays like a platformer, inside a 3D world, with strong story elements to drive the player onwards.
