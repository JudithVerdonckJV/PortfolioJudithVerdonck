        <h4>Last year gamedev student</h4>

        <p>
            Hi!<br />
            I am a last year student Game Development at Howest, Digital Arts and Entertainment, currently looking for an internship.<br />

            I enjoy the creative process behind a game and love translating the game mechanic ideas into actual code. In order to accomplish that translation, I will gladly do research and learn new things.<br />
            While big studios are not my target (as I have more interest in working on smaller games and in smaller teams), I do have the ambition to make high-quality games like Ori and the Blind Forest,
            Hades, and even Hellblade.

        <h2>A Piece of Planet</h2>
        
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>2020-2021; second year, second semester at DAE.</li>
                <li>Group of 3 artists and 2 programmers.</li>
                <li>12 weeks to make the game.</li>
                <li>C++ in Unreal Engine 4.</li>
                <br />
                <li>Tackled problems that required some research, like having a spherical, tiled planet.</li>
                <li>Took up role as project lead.</li>
                <li>Did a lot of the communication between programmers and artists (teamwork during covid-pandemic)</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>What's your life worth?</h2>
        <p>
            In this bullethell, you stumble upon a special bow, locked into a chest. Together with the talking weapon, you make your way trough chambers filled with enemies in order to finally kill the last boss.
            Along the road, you will find magical fountains, providing you with the opportunity to upgrade your bow - but beware, the upgrade will use your hp as catalyst.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>What's your life worth?</em> was made by me, entirely from scratch. This is another project from DAE and we had about 6 weeks to work our way from two random words to a fully working slice of a game.

        <h2>Combat Arena</h2>
        <p>
            While this project has some gaming elements, this was more of a learning experience then an actual attempt at making a full blown game. Again a project made for a course at DAE, this one took me about 7 weeks.
        </p>

        <p>
            It was originally meant to feature a simple, yet complete combat system, with the option for combo's, dodging, and a heavy attack for both player and AI. However, while working on this, it became painfully clear
            how little I actually knew of UE's animation system and all its possibilities. I then decided to dive into animation instead, working with combat animations but leaving the combat <em>system</em> out of it.

    <div class="PortfolioContainer" , id="Writing">
        <img class="PortfolioImage" src="Images/StoryWriting.jpg" alt="Ink bottle on desk" />
        <h2>Storywriting</h2>
        <p>
            What can I say? I write stories. It's as simple - and not as simple - as that. My head is constantly filled with characters, worlds and random ideas. Some of them I try to write down, others I just
            juggle around, reshaping it into something else, and still others become full-blown stories. Most of these are written in Dutch, my mother tongue, but a few I either tranlsated or started out in English.
        </p>

        <p>
            While school has put an abrupt halt to writing, as I simply did not have enough time for it anymore, my imagination hasn't been quiet, often adding onto or giving brand new ideas to other students.
            I also tried to at least use my writing skills in the few occasions school gave us. For example, the dev logs on <em>A Piece of Planet</em> are all written by me.

        <h2>3D - workflows</h2>
        <p>
            While I am far from an artist, I do have some knowledge of modeling, texturing, and if need be, even rigging. I have knowledge of the lowpoly workflow, high poly with normal map baking,
            and texturing in photoshop and substance painter.<br />
            It helped me communicate with artists before, and in general I just enjoy 3D.
